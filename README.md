# Hugo's Kitchen Notebook

A 100% static, free-to-host recipe app. Built with Vite + React + Tailwind CSS.
Recipes are plain Markdown files with frontmatter — no backend, no database, no build-time API calls.

## Adding a recipe

Drop a new `.md` file into [`_recipes/`](_recipes/) using this shape:

```md
---
title: My Recipe
prepTime: 30 min
portions: 4
tags: [tag-one, tag-two]
description: One sentence shown on the recipe card.
---

## Ingredients

- 500 g ingredient
- 1/2 tsp another ingredient

## Preparation

1. First step.
2. Second step.
```

- Use metric units throughout (g, kg, ml, l, cm, °C) plus normal spoon
  measurements (tsp, tbsp) — no cups, inches, ounces, pounds, or °F. The local
  LLM editor is instructed to follow this convention automatically.
- `tags` power the home page filter chips and show up as `#hashtags` on each
  recipe.
- Numbers in the `## Ingredients` list (whole numbers, fractions like `1/2`, and
  mixed numbers like `1 1/2`) are auto-detected and scaled by the portion counter
  on the recipe page.
- `aubergine`, `mushroom(s)`/`champignon(s)`, `ricotta`, `feta`, and `olive(s)`
  are automatically flagged with a highlight — edit the list in
  [`src/lib/safetyFlags.js`](src/lib/safetyFlags.js) to match what you personally avoid.
- Recipes are discovered automatically at build time via `import.meta.glob` — no
  registry file to keep in sync.

## Language

The language dropdown in the header (English / Nederlands / Français /
Deutsch) switches both the app's own text (headings, buttons, search
placeholder) **and** recipe content, if the recipe provides a translation.
To translate a recipe's title, description, ingredients, and steps, add
`title_nl`/`title_fr`/`title_de` and `description_nl`/`description_fr`/`description_de`
to the frontmatter, and matching sections in the body — e.g. `## Ingredients (nl)`
and `## Preparation (nl)` alongside the base `## Ingredients`/`## Preparation`.
Any language a recipe doesn't provide falls back to the base version instead of
showing blank — `tags` are never translated, they're the same list in every
language. The local LLM editor writes all four languages automatically when it
saves a recipe; see [`src/lib/recipeFormatPrompt.js`](src/lib/recipeFormatPrompt.js)
for the exact contract. Your language choice is remembered per browser.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Editing recipes with a local LLM

While `npm run dev` is running, open `/#/editor` (or click "Edit recipes" on
the home page) for a chat-based recipe editor backed by a local LLM. It's
dev-only — the API it talks to is a Vite middleware that never ships to the
deployed GitHub Pages site.

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pull a model, e.g. `ollama pull llama3.1`.
2. Copy `llm.config.example.json` to `llm.config.json` (already gitignored) and
   adjust `baseUrl`/`model` if you're not using Ollama's defaults — e.g. for
   [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) set `baseUrl` to `http://localhost:1234/v1`.
   Any server exposing an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint works.
3. Run `npm run dev`, open the editor, and chat with it to draft or edit a
   recipe. Either click **Insert reply into draft** to pull its output into
   the draft panel (shown as a rendered preview, not raw markdown — click
   **Edit raw markdown** if you need to tweak the text directly), tweak if
   needed, then **Save recipe** — or just say something like "save it" /
   "add this to my recipes" in the chat and the assistant saves it directly
   (it has a `save_recipe` tool for exactly this). If the draft has
   translations, language tabs (EN/NL/FR/DE) appear above the preview.
4. Mention hashtags in the chat (e.g. "tag this #quick #vegetarian") and
   they're added to the recipe's tags. Click the **gear icon** next to
   "+ New recipe" to view/edit your standing preferences (portion sizes, how
   detailed steps should be, etc.) — this is live, no code changes needed;
   [`src/lib/recipePreferences.js`](src/lib/recipePreferences.js) is only the
   fallback shown before that loads.
5. Click **Auto-tag all recipes** in the recipe list to have the assistant
   review every recipe's content and update its tags, one at a time.
6. A floating **Chat** tab (bottom-right, every page) opens the same
   assistant in an overlay, so you can keep looking at a recipe or the home
   list while talking to it instead of navigating to `/editor`.

## Fridge

Open `/#/fridge` (or click "Fridge" on the home page) for a small pantry
tracker, also dev-only and LLM-backed. Tell it what you have, just bought, or
used up — in English, Dutch, French, or German, any mix — and it keeps a
running ingredient list (stored in `fridge.json`, gitignored). Click **What
can I cook?** and it ranks your saved recipes by how well they match what's
currently on hand, noting what's missing for each.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. In [`vite.config.js`](vite.config.js), set `REPO_NAME` to match your repository
   name, e.g. `'/kitchen-notebook/'` (or `'/'` if this is a `<user>.github.io` repo).
2. Push this project to a GitHub repository on the `main` branch.
3. In the repo's **Settings → Pages**, set the source to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Push to `main` — [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
   builds the site and publishes it automatically. No paid services, no server.

The app uses a hash-based router (`/#/recipe/...`), so it works correctly on
GitHub Pages without any extra 404-redirect configuration.
